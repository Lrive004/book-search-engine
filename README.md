# Book Search Engine
  ## A Book search application that uses a Google API to render books and allows the user to save them as favorites once logged into the site.
  Completed refactored code:
  auth.js now uses an updated middlware function to work with GraphQL API
  server.js has been refactored to implement the Apollo Server and is applied to the Express server as middleware
  Added a Schemas directory with an index.js file to export the typeDefs and resolvers
  resolvers.js has the query and mutations functionality to work with mongoose models
  typeDefs.js holds the query and mutation types to work with the resolvers.

  Application needs:
  Front end specifications such as queries.js, mutations.js, and additional jsx files to complete the application.
